Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data.

Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning.
